# Random Walk On a Clock

The Problem is defined as follows:

- A Ladu bug starts at the 12 o'clock position on a clock face.
- Every second, it randomly moves either one position clockwise or one position counterclockwise with equal probability.
- The clock has 12 positions (1 to 12).
- The random walk stops after all the number of steps have been taken.
- We want to find the probability of that the bug ends up on a specific number.
